Cubed, or CubedSMP, is an invite-only community that's been around since 2019. Originally started as a Minecraft SMP with unique experiences and twists, shortly after trying new games such as "The Forest" and other survival-themed games.

If you show enough interest in our project and community, you may be deemed appropriate a spot in our community. For more information on how to join, visit [https://wiki.cubed-mc.com/start/get-invite/.](https://wiki.cubed-mc.com/start/get-invite/)
