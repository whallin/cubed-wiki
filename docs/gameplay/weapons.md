At Cubed, we have a weapons system where you can purchase some balanced yet powerful weapons to combat other gangs and players.

To explain the entire system most simply for you, the user, we made this guide on the weapons system in its entirety, so you don't have to be confused about how it works.
## Purchase weapons
Please visit one of the certified weapon dealers located around town to purchase yourself a gun or attachments to one. You'll find yourself a wall of options for different weapons, including their pricing.

If you'd rather know their pricing and specification before going to the gun store, continue reading this article, and you'll shortly know more about all available weapons.
## Gather ammunition
As with any firearm, there's no such thing as "unlimited ammunition" unless you're a dirty cheater. All the weapon descriptions tell you which ammunition type is required. You can also read the weapons list found below for each weapon and their required ammunition type.
