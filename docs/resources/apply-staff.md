Becoming a member of the Cubed staff team is easier than you think. This is since we are a community-driven network, and we are frequently looking for new staff members to join our team to assist and moderate our player base and community channels. There is a catch. Since you are getting a lot of power in your hands to do your job properly, we only allow those with a proper amount of maturity and professionalism in their behavior to join our team.

We won't be expecting availability 24/7/365. You may have other things in the day-to-day life you prioritize over assisting us in keeping Cubed running in a friendly manner, which we have a complete understanding for. As long as you can prove to us that you care about the project and that you are online at least a few times a week, then you shouldn't have any trouble keeping your title as a staff member to your name.
## Available positions
### Moderator
As a moderator at Cubed, you'll be moderating and engaging yourself closely with the community. Ensure the game servers and community servers are free of any rule-breakers, answering any questions, and assisting with issues any of our regular members might run into during their stay at Cubed and our servers.
### Administrator
Being an administrator at Cubed is a pretty daunting task. You'll be there to supervise moderators, handle support cases from regular users, educate moderators and our player base on new features, and engage with our community frequently with events and updates on the development of Cubed.
### Manager
As a Cubed manager, you'll be in charge of staff applications and making sure day-to-day operations from the rest of the staff team are going on in a good enough manner. You'll be closely developing the network and its community while making sure you're available to answer any questions from the staff team.
## How-to: Apply
There are a couple of ways to reach out to us, but we suggest utilizing our Discord server to send in a staff application properly. Join the [#create-a-ticket channel](https://discord.gg/rEzBArpASK) in our Discord server and make a ticket, and pick the topic called "Other" and make sure to let us know that you're there to apply.
???+ tip
    Please make sure you are ready when applying to provide well-structured answers to any questions we ask. We appreciate it when you, the applicant, prove that you are interested in your position by showing the capability of quickly answering our questions. Honesty and quality are important.
## Advice
- Be honest when submitting your application. We want real people in our staff team.
- Don't actively fish for a staff position. This will rarely work out well for you.
- Be respectful with your interviewer and other team members connected with your application process.
- Try and connect and build something personal with the team around you.
- Make sure you don't take application results too close to heart. You'll always have another chance at a later date.
