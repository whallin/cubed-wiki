When using the ticket system found in our Discord server, to be specific, in #create-a-ticket, then you have a few options for categories and such to pick.

To help explain each category and its use, we've made a list below explaining what each category and brand is used for and where to open your ticket if you need help with either X or Y.
## Cubed Community
"Cubed Community" can be picked to open pretty much any ticket with that's a general inquiry. Anything that doesn't have to do with in-game aspects should be opened here.
### Join Cubed
Create yourself a ticket under the "Join Cubed" category if you're interested in becoming a part of the Cubed community. You'll be given extra information on what to do to join and how to apply properly.
### Appeal punishment
Use the category "Appeal punishment" to appeal any type of punishment you've received either in Discord, Mumble, or in-game. Once you've created a ticket using this category, our staff team will tell you more about the process.
### Other
Open your ticket in the "Other" category if you deem your inquiry to not fit in any of the other categories mentioned above. Remember to give extra detail about your case when using this category.
## CubedSMP
### In-game Support
You can use "In-game Support" for any questions or troubles you may encounter on our gameplay servers. We'll try our best to assist you and report any possible issues to the development team.
### Report a bug/player
Found yourself a rulebreaker on our network or in the Discord/Mumble community? Or maybe a bug/issue? Go ahead and make a ticket in "Report a bug/player" and report it there. Please use as much detail as possible in your explination.
### Feature Request
Have any ideas on how to contribute to the gameplay or community aspects of our server? Feel free to make a feature request to us under the "Feature Request" ticket category. The more detail, the easier for us to implement your request.
### Other
Open your ticket in the "Other" category if you deem your inquiry to not fit in any of the other categories mentioned above. Remember to give extra detail about your case when using this category.
