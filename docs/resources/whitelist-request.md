Let's dive into and debunk the process of joining the invite-only community of Cubed. While joining an invite-only community or service might sound complicated at first to anyone, we will try our best to teach you how we do it here at Cubed and how to increase your chances to become a part of our family in the shortest time possible.
## Methods
### Get referred
Getting referred by an already active Cubed member will be the easiest way for you to join our community in the shortest time possible. While it might take a lot of trust-building between us at Cubed and you as the applicant, it is the method that requires the least amount of effort. The only effort you'll have to put in is when we ask you questions to build an image of you and who you are as a person.
### Make an application
We have a ticket system in our Discord that you can find in the [#create-a-ticket channel](https://discord.gg/rEzBArpASK) part of our Discord server. Create a ticket there under the group "Cubed Community" with the topic "Join Cubed". Answer the first automated questions you get, and then our staff team will be with you shortly to provide more information regarding submitting your appeal to Cubed.
### Show your interest
As strange and confusing as this might sound, you can really become a part of the Cubed family solely by showing interest and positively contributing to our community. Talk about Cubed on socials and content you produce or make pull requests, issue reports, and support tickets where you assist in developing our community-driven experience. This will, with a high guarantee, land you a whitelist at Cubed.
## Advice
- Be honest when submitting your application. We want real people in our community.
- Don't actively fish for a whitelist. This will rarely work out well for you.
- Be respectful with your interviewer and other team members connected with your application process.
- Try and connect and build something personal with the team around you.
- Make sure you don't take application results too close to heart. You'll always have another chance at a later date.
## Get assistance
If you still have questions or remain stuck with your issue after reading the documentation, you have a couple of options.
