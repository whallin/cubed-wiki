- [**Cubed Minecraft**](https://wiki.cubed-mc.com/cubedsmp/minecraft-about/): Our Minecraft network is where Cubed has its origin, and its interests haven't stopped. Our Minecraft network and SMP are still the biggest interest and activity zone, and it's what we put our resources into maintaining today.
- [**Cubed Discord**](https://wiki.cubed-mc.com/about/discord-about/): The community part of Cubed where you can text with and talk to others that have been lucky enough to become a part of the Cubed family. You could say that history is being written here.
- [**Cubed Mumble**](https://wiki.cubed-mc.com/about/mumble-about/): Cubed Mumble is a Mumble server we provide to be used for proximity chat while playing on our network of Minecraft servers. If you have any other games you want to use Mumble proximity chat on, feel free to use our server for that too, we don't mind!
