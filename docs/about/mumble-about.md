## Introduction
Cubed Mumble is the Mumble server we provide for proximity chat while playing on our Minecraft server. While it was created to use proximity chat on our survival multiplayer network, we still allow our community members to utilize the Mumble server for any other games they wish to have proximity chat on. Go ham, play some fun games and increase the fun factor with proximity chat.
