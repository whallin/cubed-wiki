## Introduction
Cubed Discord is the hub for our community. Our Discord server/community is the place for you to talk and share stories with the rest of the Cubed family members. Utilize our bots to improve your experience together. Maybe use our music bot to turn on some sweet tunes while in a voice call together? Or maybe stick around for one of our events to be hosted?
