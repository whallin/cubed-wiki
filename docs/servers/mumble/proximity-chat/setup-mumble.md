### Configure Mumble
1. Launch Mumble and make sure your screen looks like [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cubed-mc/cubed-wiki/main/docs/servers/mumble/proximity-chat/media/configure-mumble-step1.png).
2. Click ["Configure"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cubed-mc/cubed-wiki/main/docs/servers/mumble/proximity-chat/media/configure-mumble-step2.png) and proceed with the audio wizard. Read each step carefully to get the best possible audio quality.
    1. When you reach [this step](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cubed-mc/cubed-wiki/main/docs/servers/mumble/proximity-chat/media/configure-mumble-step2-1.png), do **not** check "Use headphones"â€”it will ruin the realism of the positional audio.
