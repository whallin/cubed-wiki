Before we jump into this guide, we'll assume that you've downloaded and installed [Lunar Client](https://www.lunarclient.com/) onto your system. If you haven't, then please go ahead and do so now. Lunar Client will make it easier for you to connect with the VOIP service we'll use.

If you'd rather install the mod yourself that's used to link yourself to the VOIP service, please click [this link](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1272675-1-16-5-mumblelink-forge-smp-lan-mumble-ts3) and learn more about MumbleLink and how to configure it.

!!! warning
    If you're a Linux user, the implementation of MumbleLink done by the Lunar Client developers will not work. You may either resort to installing the mod manually or utilizing a virtual machine to get a proper connection to the Mumble VOIP service.

#### Enabling Mumble support in-game
This step will be assuming you are planning to use Lunar Client. Do your own research if you are running a manual install of the MumbleLink mod.

1. Start Minecraft and Mumble and connect to our servers.
2. Press right-shift and select "Settings"
3. Search for "Mumble Link" and make sure you enable it.
4. Wait for "Minecraft linked." in the chat on the left inside of Mumble.
