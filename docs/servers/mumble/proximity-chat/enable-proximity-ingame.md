Before we jump into this guide, we'll assume that you've downloaded and installed [Lunar Client](https://www.lunarclient.com/) onto your system. If you haven't, then please go ahead and do so now. Lunar Client will make it easier for you to connect with the VOIP service we'll use.

If you'd rather install the mod yourself used to link yourself to Mumble, click [this link](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1272675-1-16-5-mumblelink-forge-smp-lan-mumble-ts3) to learn more about MumbleLink and how to install the mod manually.

???+ warning
    **If you're a Linux user**, the implementation of MumbleLink done by Lunar Client will not enable and work properly. You may either resort to installing the mod manually or utilizing a virtual machine or another system to get a proper link to the Mumble VOIP service if you wish to use Lunar Client.

#### Enabling Mumble support in-game
This step will be assuming you are using Lunar Client. Do your own research if you are running a manual install of the MumbleLink mod.

1. Start Minecraft and Mumble and connect to our servers.
2. Press right-shift and select "Settings"
3. Search for "Mumble Link" and make sure you enable it.
4. Wait for "Minecraft linked." in the chat on the left inside of Mumble.
