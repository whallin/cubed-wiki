We at Cubed support and encourage proximity chat usage while playing on our network as proximity chat is usually a huge boost to the gameplay experience factor for yourself and others. It really is fun.

## What is Proximity Chat?
Proximity chat is a feature that mimics how sound travels in real-life. The closer another player gets to you, the louder their voice gets. The opposite is also true, as the further away from the player moves, the softer the sound gets.
