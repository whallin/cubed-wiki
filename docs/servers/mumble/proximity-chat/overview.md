## Introduction
We at Cubed support and encourage proximity chat usage while playing on our network as proximity chat is usually a huge boost to the gameplay experience factor for yourself and others. Proximity chat is a feature that mimics how sound travels in real life. The closer another player gets to you, the louder their voice gets. The opposite is also true, as the further away from the player moves, the softer the sound gets.
