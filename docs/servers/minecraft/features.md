We try our very best to make as unique a Minecraft gameplay experience as possible for all our community members. Therefore we've listed everything we have implemented and developed for our Minecraft network so far to try and provide the best possible experience for our players.

## Gameplay Features
- **Gangs**: Create a gang and combat with others to climb to the leaderboards' highest positions.
- **Drugs**: Plant, farm, and consume drugs and other substances to give you a temporary boost with some slight side effects.
- **Weapons**: Practice your combat with firearms and explosives for the big gang attacks.
- **Proximity Chat**: Bring a sense of realism to the audio experience by having proper surround sound for player voices.
- **Economy**: Work for some cash to later invest in whatever your heart desires.
## Back-end Features
- **Anti-cheat**: Never worry about having to encounter cheaters. We run an enterprise-grade anti-cheat to combat any inhumane activities.
- **Anti-exploit**: Crashers and exploits to ruin your experience are blocked by our systems to remain server stable 24/7.
- **DDoS Protection**: Downtime due to (distributed)-denial-of-service attacks are prevented in realtime to make sure you have the best connection possible.
- **Load Balancing**: No matter where you are on the globe, our systems allow you to have the best ping possible while still playing on the same server like everyone else.
