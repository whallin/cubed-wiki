You're looking to becoming a part of the Cubed community? Unsure of where to start or how to get in? It really isn't that hard, and we'll try our best to explain all the possible ways to you right here and now.

## Get referred
If an already member of Cubed becomes a referee of yours and proves your maturity and interest in the community, then you may be able to become a part of the community without having to submit a completed application. This is the least time-consuming way to get in but maybe the hardest to achieve.

## Apply for an invite
You can join our [Discord server](https://discord.cubed-mc.net/) and create a ticket where you can answer a couple of questions about yourself and, in that way, apply to join our community. This is a pretty quick way of joining Cubed, but it may require some additional steps and investigations, depending on your answers.

## Show interest
In case you decide to contribute in any way or form to our wiki or process of research and development, we may offer you an invite on our own to the community. It would require a lot of work to get an invite by this method, but you can definitely retrieve one if your interest and contributions are deemed good enough.
