You may access Cubed on multiple platforms, and it might be hard to know which address and other information to use to connect to each of our servers. 

So that's why we made this small piece of documentation letting you know where you can find us and how to access us at the said platform.
## Minecraft
Add "play.cubed-mc.com" to your server list and connect. Please make sure you're on the proper Minecraft version before connecting, as we only support one Minecraft version each season.
## Mumble
Connect using "play.cubed-mc.com" and the default Mumble port (64738). This will let you onto our official Mumble server.
## Discord
You can access our Discord server by going to [https://discord.cubed-mc.com/.](https://discord.cubed-mc.com/)
## Wiki
You may visit [https://wiki.cubed-mc.com/](https://wiki.cubed-mc.com/) to access the entirety of our wiki.
