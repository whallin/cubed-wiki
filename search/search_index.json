The process of submitting an appeal might take a little while, depending on where you've been punished and for what. How-to: Appeal There are a couple of ways to reach out to us, but we suggest utilizing our Discord server to send a punishment appeal properly. Join the #create-a-ticket channel in our Discord server and make a ticket, and pick the topic called \"Other\" and make sure to let us know that you're there to appeal a punishment. Tip If you know that your punishment is only temporary, you are usually better off waiting for it to expire by itself. Appealing a punishment that is only temporary will have less chance of getting lifted than one that is permanent. Advice Be honest when submitting your appeal. We can see every aspect of what got you your punishment. Don't actively alert staff of your appeal. This will not help you get a response faster and will lower your chances of acceptance drastically. Make sure you don't take the appeal results too close to heart.
